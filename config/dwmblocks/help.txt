# during instalation you might face an error of no finding --libs X11 (-lX11)

# bypass this we have to the manuall installation of dwmblocks.c file
# for that try the following command

gcc dwmblocks.c -lX11 -o dwmblocks 


# then you have to manually copy the dwmblocks to /usr/local/bin so that it can run from any where
